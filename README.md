## Introduction

The Plex Sandbox Operator is an operator for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) that enables authenticated users to a cluster to create their own isolated environments.

## Installation

### Kustomize

This repository contains a [deploy](deploy) folder which contains all of the manifests required to deploy the operator, as well as a `kustomization.yaml` file.

If you would like to apply your own customizations, reference the `deploy` folder and the version in your `kustomization.yaml`.

```yaml
resources:
- git::https://github.com/plexsystems/sandbox-operator.git//deploy?ref=v0.4.0
```

Additionally, the [example](example) folder shows one example of how to customize the operator.

### Bundle

Alternatively, a [bundle.yaml](bundle.yaml) is provided in the root of the repository which can then be applied via `kubectl apply`.

### Created ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding

After installing the operator, a `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` will be created for all _authenticated_ users in your cluster.

### ClusterRole (sandbox-users)

|Verbs|API Groups|Resources|
|---|---|---|
|create, list, get|operators.plex.dev|sandboxes|

### ClusterRoleBinding (sandbox-user)

|API Group|Name|Subjects|
|---|---|---|
|rbac.authorization.k8s.io|sandbox-users|system:authenticated|

### Created Sandbox CRD

After installing the operator, a `CustomResourceDefinition` named `Sandbox` will be created.

An example manifest for the Sandbox CRD is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.plex.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Sandbox
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  owners:
  - foo@bar.com
```

## Configuration

The sandbox operator can leverage different clients, depending upon how authenitcation is configured for your cluster.

### Azure

If Azure credentials are provided to the operators environment, it will perform a lookup of each user in the owners field and fetch that users `ObjectID` inside of Azure using [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/azure-ad-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0).

This enables users to create Sandboxes with friendly names, such as their email address, and have the operator itself handle the mapping when creating the Kubernetes resources.

To use the Azure client, include the following environment variables:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`

### Default

If no credentials are provided, the operator will create the `Role` and `ClusterRole` bindings using the values listed in the owners field.

## Creating a Sandbox

To create a Sandbox, create and apply a Sandbox CRD to the target cluster.

The following will create a Sandbox called `foo` (the resulting namespace being `sandbox-foo`), and assign the RBAC policies to user `foo@bar.com`.

### sandbox-foo.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.plex.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Sandbox
metadata:
  name: foo
spec:
  size: small
  owners:
  - foo@bar.com
```

```console
$ kubectl apply -f sandbox-foo.yaml
sandboxes.operators.plex.dev "foo" created
```

## Created Resources

Assuming the name of the created Sandbox is named `foo`, the following resources will be created per Sandbox:

### Namespace (sandbox-foo)

### ClusterRole (sandbox-foo-deleter)

|Verbs|API Groups|Resources|ResourceNames|
|---|---|---|---|
|delete|operators.plex.dev|sandboxes|sandbox-foo|

This is created so that only users defined in the `owners` field can delete their Sandboxes.

### ClusterRoleBinding (sandbox-foo-deleters)

One `ClusterRoleBinding` per name in the `owners` field

### Role (sandbox-foo-owner)

|Verbs|API Groups|Resources|
|---|---|---|
|*|core|pods, pods/log, services, services/finalizers, endpoints, persistentvolumeclaims, events, configmaps, replicationcontrollers|
|*|apps|deployments, daemonsets, replicasets, statefulsets|
|*|autoscaling|horizontalpodautoscalers|
|*|batch|jobs, cronjobs|
|create, list, get|rbac.authorization.k8s.io|roles, rolebindings|

### RoleBinding (sandbox-foo-owners)

One `RoleBinding` per name in the `owners` field

### ResourceQuota (sandbox-foo-resourcequota)

The `ResourceQuota` that is applied to the `Namespace` depends on the `size` of the `Sandbox` that was created.

#### Small

|Resource Name|Quantity|
|---|---|
|ResourceRequestsCPU|0.25|
|ResourceLimitsCPU|0.5|
|ResourceRequestsMemory|250Mi|
|ResourceLimitsMemory|500Mi|
|ResourceRequestsStorage|10Gi|
|ResourcePersistentVolumeClaims|2|

#### Large

|Resource Name|Quantity|
|---|---|
|ResourceRequestsCPU|1|
|ResourceLimitsCPU|2|
|ResourceRequestsMemory|2Gi|
|ResourceLimitsMemory|8Gi|
|ResourceRequestsStorage|40Gi|
|ResourcePersistentVolumeClaims|8|

```text
NOTE: If no size is given, small is the default.
```

## Managing Owners of a Sandbox

After the Sandbox has been created, you can add or remove owners that are associated to it.

For example, to add `more@bar.com` as an owner, add their name to the list of owners and apply the changes:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.plex.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Sandbox
metadata:
  name: foo
spec:
  size: small
  owners:
  - foo@bar.com
  - more@bar.com
```

```console
$ kubectl apply -f sandbox-foo.yaml
sandboxes.operators.plex.dev "foo" configured
```

This will cause the operator to add `ClusterRoleBinding` and `RoleBinding` resources to match the owners list.

## Deleting a Sandbox

To delete a Sandbox, delete the Sandbox resource from the cluster:

```console
$ kubectl delete sandbox foo
sandboxes.operators.plex.dev "foo" deleted
```

Deleting a Sandbox will delete the `Namespace` as well as the `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` resources

## Metrics

The operator exposes two metric ports for the `/metrics` end point:

- Port `8383` exposes metrics for the operator itself
- Port `8686` exposes metrics for the `Sandbox` CRD

Additionally, if [prometheus-operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) is installed into the cluster, a `ServiceMonitor` is created for the operator

## Development

No external tooling is required to develop and build the operator. However, some tooling is required to run the integration tests and validate the manifests:

- [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)
- [Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize)

## Testing

The provided `Makefile` contains commands that assist with running the tests for the operator.

### Unit tests

`make test-unit` will use an in-memory kubernetes client to validate and test your changes without the need for an external Kubernetes cluster.

### Integration tests

`make test-integration` will create a Kubernetes cluster for you, using Kind, and deploy the operator to it. The integration tests will then be ran against the newly created cluster.

**NOTE:** To test the operator with different versions of Kubernetes, you can use the `KUBERNETES_VERSION` variable when calling `make`. For example, to test on Kubernetes v1.16.3, run the following command:

`make test-integration KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.16.3`
